# Web Scraping Projects

Welcome to my web scraping projects repository! Here, I share code and scripts that collect and organize data from websites using Python.

## What's Inside
These projects focus on:
- **Gathering Data**: Pulling information from web pages.
- **Cleaning & Organizing**: Making the data neat and structured.
- **Saving Results**: Storing data in formats like CSV for easy use.

## Tools I Use
- **Python**: The main language for writing the scripts.
- **BeautifulSoup**: To help parse and make sense of the HTML content.
- **Requests/HTTPX**: To fetch web page content.

## Current Project
- [eBay Consumer Electronics Scraper](https://github.com/dani-gallego/Portfolio-Project/tree/main/Web%20Scraping/Ebay%20Consumer%20Electronics): This project grabs product names and prices from eBay and updates a CSV file, adding new data as it finds it.
